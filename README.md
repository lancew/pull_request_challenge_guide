# Introduction
This repo is a collection of ideas you can use to run a CPAN Pull Request Challenge event (or similar) in a team (for example with your work colleagues).

It was suggested to share the "how" of doing the CPAN Pull Request Challenge, after giving a talk at The Perl Conference in Amsterdam on how as a team we have been doing the challenge within my company www.cv-library.co.uk.

# Overview
Once each month you are allocated a Perl module from CPAN and your goal is to make a contribution to that module via a pull request on Github.

From the 2017 challenge and onwards, teams have been able to participate as well as individuals.

## Background
Homepage for the challenge: http://cpan-prc.org/

### History
After the 2014 "CPAN Day", Neil Bowers created the Pull Request Challenge. In 2015 and 2016, participation was by individuals only. In 2017, the first team (CV-Library LINK) joined the challenge with Neil Bowers blessing.

# Getting Involved
* Team Github account
> We use a shared company github account, but individual accounts also can be (and are) used.

* Email Neil Bowers
> We emailed Neil and asked if we could do the challenge as a team and he said yes, we sent him out Github account name and a group email and that was all it took.

* Mailing list or shared group email
> We used a pre-existing group emai address (for one of our dev teams), we could/should use awider distribution list. You might want to consider setting up a mailing list also so that everyone can join or leave. Getting your assignment sent to a shared email is important as if it goes to a single person and that person is away it delays knowing about the module.
# Getting organised

* Set a date, start time and end time.
> At CV-Library we do our event on the third Wednesday of each month. This was chosen as it was an evening most people are available.
> Having a fixed date helps people schedule it into their busy lives
> Having a fixed finish time is helpful too, it helps some people decide if they can attend.


## Pre-event
* Send invitation. Send your invitation to a wide audience... not just developers.
> At CV-Library we invite the entire  "Tech Team", we have participation from a more diverse group of people. Includes desktop support, web developers, testers, operations, and more.
> Include the date, times and objectives of the evening. New people might not even know what you are talking about.
> We put links to the module and where possible a quick explanation of what the module is about.

* Email the module author
> We email the author of the module in advance and let them know what we are planning on doing.
> We often get a reply and suggestions on things to look at and things to avoid. Share those replies with the participants/invitees.

* Encourage participation and exploration
> If people have played with the odule, browsed the code, looked at the bug tracker it can really help on the day/evening of the event.
> Much time can be lost if nobody has explored the module in advance.

## Event
* Food
> We order food (normally pizza), and we do it first and get it delivered.
* Introduction
> While we wait for the food to arrive, we get everyone together and talk about the module. We look at the bug tracker, kwalitee etc.
> We will talk and decide some ideas on what we want to try and do, we will then try and decide who will work together on which ideas.
* Todo list
> We try to write a list of possible tasks on the whiteboard, then put names to them. Ideally we pair people from across teams.
> We also try and look at the following areas for ideas of what to work on:
> * Issue tracker(s)
> * Kwalitee
> * CPANTS errors
> * .travis.yaml configuration
> * We have started also integrating Kritika.io to identify perlcritic type issues (running perlcritic is also a good idea)
* Fork the project
> We fork the branch with our corporate github account, all team members are given access.
* Clone the repo
> Everyone clones our fork of the project.
> We create a branch per task, this helps isolate changes and make pull requests easier.
* Code
> We try to get people who don't work together normally to work together on tasks.
* Finish
> People will drift away depending on their timetables, but it is worth perhaps deciding on a hard finish time (some people will try and stay all night).

## Post-event
* Tidy-up (do the dishes, etc)
> Be nice to your office colleagues, tidy up and do good job of it. You do not want to annoy people.
> Equally, that time cleaning up is chat time, getting to know peopl time... which is valuable.

* Email Neil Bowers and say "Done".
> Collect the url(s) for your pull request(s) and reply back to the original assignment email saying that you finished ("Done") along with the pullrequests URL(s).

* Email the author
> Let the author know you held the event and what you did, tell them you made some pull requests.
> At CV-Library we have found that the authors react really positively,
> Share any/all replies from the author with everyone (perhaps just snippets).
