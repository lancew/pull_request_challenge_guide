# Introduction
This repo is a collection of ideas you can use to run a CPAN Pull Request Challenge event (or similar) in a team (for example with your work colleagues).

It was suggested to share the "how" of doing the CPAN Pull Request Challenge, after giving a talk at The Perl Conference in Amsterdam on how as a team we have been doing the challenge within my company www.cv-library.co.uk.

# Overview

Once each month you are allocated a Perl module from CPAN and your goal is to make a contribution to that module via a pull request on Github.
