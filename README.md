# Introduction
This repo is a collection of ideas you can use to run a CPAN Pull Request Challenge event (or similar) in a team (for example with your work colleagues).

It was suggested to share the "how" of doing the CPAN Pull Request Challenge, after giving a talk at The Perl Conference in Amsterdam on how as a team we have been doing the challenge within my company www.cv-library.co.uk.

# Overview

Once each month you are allocated a Perl module from CPAN and your goal is to make a contribution to that module via a pull request on Github.

From the 2017 challenge and onwards, teams have been able to participate as well as individuals.

## Background
Homepage for the challenge: http://cpan-prc.org/

### History


# Getting Involved
* Team Github account
* Email Neil Bowers

# Getting organised

* Set a date and times.

> At CV-Library we do our event on the third Wednesday of each month. This was chosen as it was an evening most people are available.
> Having a fixed date helps people schedule it into their busy lives
> Having a fixed finish time is helpful too, it helps some people decide if they can attend.



## Pre-event
* Send invitation. Send your invitation to a wide audience... not just developers.

> At CV-Library we invite the entire  "Tech Team", we have participation from a more diverse group of people. Includes desktop support, web developers, testers, operations, and more.
> Include the date, times and objectives of the evening. New people might not even know what you are talking about.
> We put links to the module and where possible a quick explanation of what the module is about.

* Email the module author

> We email the author of the module in advance and let them know what we are planning on doing.
> We often get a reply and suggestions on things to look at and things to avoid.
